## Importing and combining the transmuted data frames

In the following four code chunks the transmutation files are being executed. The transmutation files themselves rely on their respective "<name>_originals" file which uses data that is scraped from Wikipedia to identify the original creations from the streaming services.

```{r child = 'netflix_transmutation.Rmd'}
```

```{r child = 'amazon_prime_transmutation.Rmd'}
```

```{r child = 'disney_transmutation.Rmd'}
```

```{r child = 'hulu_transmutation.Rmd'}
```

The goal now is to combine the results from the transmutation into one large data frame that can then be explored to gain a general grasp of what the data looks like for originals from four of the largest streaming services.
