## Introduction

As the market for original content from various streaming services has grown throughout the years, the question why these companies are following this route arises. We want to statistically check whether the route of more and more original content instead of licensed content is promising or not.

To do this analysis, we are using scraped data from various Wikipedia pages. For this purpose we have been using an external web scraper that scrapes all the <table> elements from the web page and converts them into a CSV format.

The web scraping tool can be found here:

## Disclaimer

If you run into any problems (can be recognized by missing Premiere values on the first page of the data frame called "netflix"), please make sure to contact us, because there are various options for unix-based operating systems and we did not want to include them all for the case that they might conflict with each other.


## Installing required libraries

The first code chunk makes sure, that all the required libraries are installed. The "**forcats**" library is included with the "**tidyverse**" but does not open all its functionality to the developer, so it needed to be required specifically as well. To ensure correct parsing of the dates during the original content transmutation the locale is set to an english one.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(forcats)
library(magrittr)
library(readxl)
library(knitr)
library(lazyeval)
Sys.setlocale("LC_TIME", "English") #Windows
Sys.setlocale("LC_TIME", "en_GB.UTF-8") #Linux & Unix
```

## Dataset Import

The upcoming chapter deals with the import of the scraped and downloaded CSVs into tibbles. Due to the huge amount and inconsistencies of the CSV files the importing process was very tedious and every single csv file needed to be inspected and merged manually. This is performed for all of the streaming services.

### Custom functions for Import Phase

To exclude specific rows that do not match one of the specified statuses formats or origins, the only_keep() function was written to ease the access of parsing the factors after matching parts of the previous entry to unify the content of the column.

```{r}
only_keep <- function(row, regex, factor) {
  return(parse_factor(str_match(row, regex)[,2], levels = factor))
}

status_regex <- "(Renewed|Pending|Miniseries|Awaiting release|Event|Development|Ended|Film|Special|Distribution)"

format_regex <- "(Series|Miniseries|Film|Special)"

origin_regex <- "(Continuation|Distribution|Original)"

statuses <- c("Renewed", "Pending", "Miniseries", "Awaiting release", "Event", "Development", "Ended", "Film", "Special", "Distribution")

formats <- c("Series", "Miniseries", "Film", "Special")

origins <- c("Continuation", "Distribution", "Original")

services <- c("Netflix", "Amazon Prime Video", "Hulu", "Disney+", "Apple TV+")

ages <- c("0+", "6+", "7+", "12+", "13+", "16+", "18+", "all", "unknown")
```

## Import Netflix

To import all the required data, all 115 csv files need to be imported and in some cases values have to be added, e.g. because the entry was found in a table for specific genres, but the genre was not further specified in the actual cells of the rows.

```{r netflix_displayed_import, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
netflix_originals_1 <- read_csv("../datasets/netflix/shows/table-1.csv") %>%
  transmute(Title = Title,
            Genre = paste(Genre, " Drama"),
            Premiere = Premiere,
            Seasons = Seasons,
            Runtime = Runtime,
            Language = NA,
            Status = Status,
            Format = "Series",
            Origin = "Original",
            Network = NA,
            Region = NA)
```

After importing the data into 115 individual data frames, the tables now need to me merged horizontally using the **rbind()** function. This function requires the tables to have NA values for the columns that were not originally specified in the CSV files, thus the large amount of NA transmutes.

```{r netflix_hidden_import, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
netflix_originals_2 <- read_csv("../datasets/netflix/shows/table-2.csv")
netflix_originals_2 <- transmute(netflix_originals_2,
                                 Title = Title,
                                 Genre = paste(Genre, "Comedy"),
                                 Premiere = Premiere,
                                 Seasons = Seasons,
                                 Runtime = Runtime,
                                 Language = NA,

                                 Format = "Series",

After the data frames named netflix_originals_1 to netflix_originals_115 have been horizontally merged, we make sure that the individual data frames are not accessible as global variables, so we make sure, that they are deleted from the R session. This also helps to improve the performance of further actions, since it reduces the RAM usage of the system by a lot.

## Import large Movies and Shows data set

Since the goal is to point out the unique trademarks of original content, there is need for importing large data sets for movies and shows, that are available on streaming services, but not necessarily original content.

For this purpose we are using datasets provided by [Ruchi Bhatia](https://www.kaggle.com/ruchi798) which can be found on the following pages:

* [Movies on Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu and Disney+](https://www.kaggle.com/ruchi798/movies-on-netflix-prime-video-hulu-and-disney)
* [TV shows on Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu and Disney+](https://www.kaggle.com/ruchi798/tv-shows-on-netflix-prime-video-hulu-and-disney)

## Transmute Netflix

### Transmutation of the given Netflix series and movie table

After the data has been imported into the correct columns in the "netflix_originals.Rmd" file, we are now going to transmute the data into the proper data types and into readable formats, as it is needed with multi-value cells like the Genre. For this, we needed a function that parses the value of the cells for the Genre and unifies the content, so that we can be sure that it is in a format that can be properly plotted afterwards.

After the function has been defined, we can start converting the columns of the data frame into their respective data types, so that it is easier to deal with them during the plotting process. This means, that the premiere is being converted into a Date object and the Seasons column as well as the Runtime column are converted and split up, so that there are only integer values left. The rest of the columns is just carried over.

```{r}
(netflix_originals %<>% filter_originals())

## Transmute Amazon Prime Video

### Transmutation of the given Amazon Prime series and movie table

rm("hulu_originals")
```

## Transmute Disney+

### Transmutation of the given Disney+ series and movie table

```{r}
(disney_originals %<>% filter_originals())
(disney <- transmute_originals(disney_originals))

rm("disney_originals")
```

## Transmute Apple TV+

### Production of original content throughout the years

To see how the production of original content has evolved over the years, we wanted to take a look at how many productions have been produced in each year. The assumption we want to check against is that there is more original content produced by the streaming services over time, since they want to avoid paying fees for the licenses to provide all the movies and series.

To make the following plots easier to read, we picked colors from the streaming services' logos, so that the readers can identify the streaming services more naturally.

```{r}
# Adding a column to sort by, will be used as a categorical variable later on
prem_year <- filter(mutate(original_content, Premiere_Year = lubridate::year(Premiere)), Premiere_Year != 2021, !is.na(Premiere_Year))

original_colors <- c(rgb(229/255, 9/255, 20/255, 1),
                     rgb(0/255, 163/255, 218/255, 1),
                     rgb(28/255, 231/255, 131/255, 1),
                     rgb(148/255, 31/255, 138/255, 1),
                     rgb(0, 0, 0, 1))

ggplot(data = prem_year, mapping = aes(x = Premiere_Year, fill = as.factor(Service))) +
  geom_bar() +
  theme(title = element_text(size = 14), axis.title = element_text(size = 12), legend.title = element_text(size = 12), legend.text = element_text(size = 10)) +
  labs(fill = "Premiere Year", title = "Release Years", x = "Release Year", y = "Number of movies and series") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = original_colors)
```
Linear regression model for the amount of original content until 2050

```{r}
years <- c(2005:2020)

productions <- function(years, dataframe) {
  productions <- c()
  for (year in years) {
    productions <- c(productions, nrow(filter(select(dataframe, Premiere_Year), Premiere_Year == year)))
  }
  return(productions)
}

linear_regression <- lm(years ~ productions(years, prem_year), data = filter(prem_year, is.na(match(Premiere_Year, years))))
summary(linear_regression)
plot(linear_regression)
```

### Change in Netflix content origin over the years

```{r}
origin_change_area(origin_change(2007, "Netflix"))
```

### Change in Amazon Prime Video content origin over the years

```{r}
origin_change_area(origin_change(2006, "Prime Video"))
```

### Change in Hulu content origin over the years

```{r}
origin_change_area(origin_change(2007, "Hulu"))
```

### Change in Disney+ content origin over the years

```{r}
origin_change_area(origin_change(2019, "Disney+"))
```

### Change in Apple TV+ content origin over the years

```{r}
origin_change_area(origin_change(2019, "Apple TV+"))
```

### Production of original content grouped by months

In society there is a common agreement, that most of the interesting movies and series get released during the autumn and winter months, so we made sure to check whether this claim holds up to be true for original content as well.

```{r}
prem_month <- filter(mutate(original_content,
                              Premiere_Month = as.character(lubridate::month(lubridate::ymd(010101) +
                                                                               months(lubridate::month(Premiere) - 1), label = TRUE, abbr = TRUE))),
                              lubridate::year(Premiere) != 2021, !is.na(lubridate::year(Premiere)))

ggplot(data = prem_month, mapping = aes(x = reorder(Premiere_Month, lubridate::month(Premiere)),fill = as.factor(Service))) +
  geom_bar(width = 0.85) +
  theme(title = element_text(size = 14), axis.title = element_text(size = 12), legend.title = element_text(size = 12), legend.text = element_text(size = 10)) +
  labs(fill = "Premiere Month", title = "Release Months", x = "Release Month", y = "Number of movies and series") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = original_colors)
```
From our feeling the amount of series compared to movies has also increased steadily, so we figured out that it is interesting to take a look at how the ratio evolved throughout the years for the various streaming services.
We first started off by creating two separate graphs that display us the amount of movies or series grouped by the streaming services, but as you can see, it does not really help the situation since there is a general tendency that the streaming services produce more original content either way.
This has lead to the approach that is displayed in the last of the three graphs. We set out that 50% is the baseline for the case that there are no movies and series produced. From there on we can determine what the ratio of series produced to the number of produced movies is. For Netflix for example, it is realistic to say that there is trend that can be recognized from the data that has been gathered so far.

```{r}
series_and_movies <- as_tibble(filter(prem_year %>%
  group_by(Service, Premiere_Year = strtoi(Premiere_Year), Format) %>%
  summarise(Entries = length(Service)), Format == "Film" | Format == "Series"))
series_and_movies

percentage_of_series <- function(dataframe) {
  series_percentages <- data.frame(Service = c(), Premiere_Year = c(), Series_Percentage = c())
  years <- c(2000:2020)
  for (service in services) {
    service_rows <- filter(dataframe, Service == service)
    for (year in years) {
      nr_series <- sum(pull(filter(service_rows, Format == "Series", Premiere_Year == year), Entries))
      nr_films <- sum(pull(filter(service_rows, Format == "Film", Premiere_Year == year), Entries))
      series_percentages <- rbind(series_percentages,
                                  data.frame(Service = as.factor(c(service)), Premiere_Year = c(year), Percentage = c(ifelse(nr_series == 0,
                                    ifelse(nr_films == 0, 50, 0), ifelse(nr_films == 0, 100, nr_series / (nr_series + nr_films) * 100)))))
    }
  }
  return(series_percentages)
}
percentage_of_series(series_and_movies)

ggplot() +
  geom_line(data = filter(series_and_movies, Format == "Film"), mapping = aes(x = Premiere_Year, y = Entries, colour = as.factor(Service)), label = "Movie") +

In order to make it reusable for other people, we also wanted to export our final data frame for following usage. We are also planning to publish this data set to Kaggle.

```{r}
write.csv(original_content, "../original_content.csv", row.names = TRUE)
```
